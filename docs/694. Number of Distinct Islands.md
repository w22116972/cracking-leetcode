# Number of Distinct Islands

[694. Number of Distinct Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-distinct-islands/)

### Assumption

- the length of the grid is at least 1
- `m` and `n` are positive integers
- cells in `grid` are either `0` or `1`

### Algorithm

To identify a distinct island, we need to know its shape. Here are two ways to identify the shape of an island:
- **Coordinates** of the cells + normalization
    1. Normalize `[2, 1][2, 2]` to `[1, 0][1, 1]`
    2. Put `[1, 0][1, 1]` into hash set 
- **Directions** of the cells (Because either DFS or BFS will traverse the cells in the **same order from the same starting point**)
  - e.g. `R`: right, `L`: left, `U`: up, `D`: down
